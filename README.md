## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
List of my favorite applications along with 2-3 features that make them my favorite app.
-tiktok
tiktok has a for you page that is content curated just for you using an algorthim 
tiktok has a stem category that allows the user to only see stem related content
-twitter
twitter has a follow feature that notifies you when a user you follow has posted a tweet
twitter has a feature that lets you see others post called a timeline
-instagram
instagram has a feature called reels that lets you see endless videos
instagram has a feature that lets you write notes that others users can see

A app I would like to create is a tinder for dogs. This app would allow owners to plan playdates with people and their dogs. This app would have a messaging feature.

## Notes

Some challenges I have encountered while building the app was keeping the lables alligned and in the middle of the UI
